# End-to-End-Genomic-Risk-Prediction-System-using-CNN-Transformer-Architecture-PyTorch-
This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for genomic risk prediction using DNA sequence data. The system is designed to simulate real-world biotech and precision medicine workflows, where raw genomic sequences are transformed into actionable biological insights.
